    git clone https://github.com/AdityaSSingh0/VaultBridge-.git
    cd VaultBridge
    ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install cryptography
    ```
    ```sh
    pip install socket
    ```
    ```sh
    pip install tkinter
    ```

### Usage

1. **Run the Tool**:
    ```sh
    python VaultBridge.py
    ```

2. **Sending a File**:
    - Open **VaultBridge** and select "Send".
    - Enter the recipient's host address and port.
    - Choose the file you want to send.
    - Enter a secure password.
    - Click "Execute" to send the file.

3. **Receiving a File**:
    - Open **VaultBridge** and select "Receive".
    - Enter the port to listen on.
    - Enter the password that the sender will use.
    - Click "Execute" to start listening for incoming files.

### Example Usage

#### Sending a File:

1. Start the **VaultBridge** tool.
2. Select "Send".
3. Enter the recipient's host (e.g., `192.168.1.4`).
4. Enter the port (e.g., `12345`).
5. Choose the file you want to send.
6. Enter a secure password (e.g., `mypassword`).
7. Click "Execute".

#### Receiving a File:

1. Start the **VaultBridge** tool.
2. Select "Receive".
3. Enter the port (e.g., `12345`).
4. Enter the same password used by the sender (e.g., `mypassword`).
5. Click "Execute".

Both sides must use the same port and password. Ensure firewalls or antivirus software allow the communication.

### Security

**VaultBridge** employs several security mechanisms to ensure your files are safe:

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Strong encryption standard to protect your files.
- **PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256**: Robust key derivation function to secure your password.
- **IV (Initialization Vector)**: Random IV for each encryption session to ensure uniqueness.


### Disclaimer

**VaultBridge** provides strong encryption and secure communication channels, but its effectiveness depends on user practices:

Always use a strong and unique password.

Never share passwords over insecure channels.

Avoid transferring sensitive files over untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi.

**VaultBridge** does not upload or store files ‚Äî everything is processed securely on your own device.
